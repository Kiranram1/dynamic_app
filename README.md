# Dynamic Memory Allocation Learning Platform

This was an educational platform designed as a part of our **Design Thinking LAB** of our academics.IT aims to simplify and visualize **Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA)** concepts in C, C++, and related programming languages. Built with  Basic **HTML** and **CSS**, it offers interactive simulations, real-time memory maps, quizzes, and gamified challenges to make memory management concepts accessible and engaging for students, educators, and self-learners.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Develop **conceptual clarity** of DMA (stack vs. heap).
- Visualize **malloc, calloc, realloc, free** operations.
- Explore **memory fragmentation, leaks, and best practices**.
- Practice with **interactive simulations and quizzes**.
- Build stronger **debugging skills** for real-world coding.

---

## 💡 Design Thinking Framework
We apply a **learner-centered approach**:
1. **Empathize** → Students often find DMA abstract and error-prone.
2. **Define** → Key challenge: bridging *theory vs. practice*.
3. **Ideate** → Use **visual simulations** + **interactive coding**.
4. **Prototype** → Build modular lessons, heap visualizer, and quizzes.
5. **Test & Iterate** → Gather feedback from students/mentors.

## 🛠 Features
- 📊 **Heap Visualizer** – Animated blocks showing allocation/free.
- 🎮 **Gamified Challenges** – Solve real-world DMA problems.
- 📝 **Quizzes & Assessments** – Test conceptual clarity.
- 💻 **Code Playground** – Try and debug DMA snippets.
- 📈 **Progress Tracking** – Unlock badges & levels.

## 🔮 Conclusion
This project is not just a **learning tool** but a **step toward rethinking how we teach low-level programming concepts**. By blending **visual intuition** with **hands-on coding**, we aim to make Dynamic Memory Allocation **less error-prone, more engaging, and deeply understood**.
